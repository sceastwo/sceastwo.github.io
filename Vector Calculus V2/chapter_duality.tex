This section will now establish the connection that exists between multi-paths and multi-surfaces that will henceforth be referred to as ``duality".


\section{Point-volume duality}

To quantify a multi-point \(\rho\), at each position \(\mathbf{q}\) only one value \(\rho(\mathbf{q})\) is required. 

To quantify a multi-volume \(U\), at each position \(\mathbf{q}\) only one value \(U(\mathbf{q})\) is also required. 

The fact that multi-points and multi-volumes both only require 1 value suggests that points and volumes can be ``interchanged". When a multi-point and a multi-volume are interchangeable, they will be referred to as being ``dual" to each other.

\begin{tabular}{cc}
\parbox{0.5\textwidth}{
Given a point \(P\) with an {\bf infinitesimal} weight of \(w\), then the volume that is ``dual" to \(P\) is an infinitesimal volume \(\Omega\) that both contains \(P\) and has a volume of \(w\). 

Given an {\bf infinitesimal} volume \(\Omega\) with a volume of \(\Delta V\), then the point that is ``dual" to \(\Omega\) is a point \(P\) that is contained by \(\Omega\) and has a weight of \(\Delta V\).

Consider a multi-volume \(U\). Multi-volume \(U\) consists of a single volume with a weight of \(1\). The multi-point \(\rho\) that is ``dual" to \(\Omega\) is a uniform ``cloud" of points each with an infinitesimal weight. The average total weight per unit volume is \(1\). In the image on the right, a large volume is shattered into infinitesimal volumes, each shard of which is dual to point with a weight equal to the volume of said shard.

While there is no unique way of exactly placing the dual points or sketching the dual volumes, once ``smoothing" has been applied none of this matters.

Given a multi-volume \(U\), the multi-point \(\rho\) that is ``dual" to \(U\) will be denoted via the notation:
\[\rho = \iota(U)\]
or conversely, 
\[U = \iota^{-1}(\rho)\]

The following is important to note:
\begin{itemize}
\item The dual of the union is the union of the duals:
\[\iota(U_1 + U_2) = \iota(U_1) + \iota(U_2)
\quad\quad\text{and}\quad\quad
\iota^{-1}(\rho_1 + \rho_2) = \iota^{-1}(\rho_1) + \iota^{-1}(\rho_2)\]
If \(c\) is an arbitrary real valued coefficient, then:
\[\iota(c \cdot U) = c \cdot \iota(U)
\quad\quad\text{and}\quad\quad
\iota^{-1}(c \cdot \rho) = c \cdot \iota^{-1}(\rho)\]
\end{itemize}




\section{Path-surface duality}

To quantify a multi-path \(\mathbf{J}\), at each position \(\mathbf{q}\) three values \(\begin{bmatrix} J_1(\mathbf{q}) \\ J_2(\mathbf{q}) \\ J_3(\mathbf{q}) \end{bmatrix}\) are required. 

To quantify a multi-surface \(\mathbf{F}\), at each position \(\mathbf{q}\) three values \(\begin{bmatrix} F_1(\mathbf{q}) \\ F_2(\mathbf{q}) \\ F_3(\mathbf{q}) \end{bmatrix}\) are also required. 

The fact that multi-paths and multi-surface both require 3 values suggests that paths and surfaces can be ``interchanged". When a multi-path and multi-surface are interchangeable, they will be referred to as being ``dual" to each other.

Given an infinitesimal segment of path \(C\) with an infinitesimal weight, the surface \(\sigma\) that is ``dual" to \(C\) is: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Infinitesimal in both size and weight.
\item Perpendicular to \(C\). 
\item The direction of \(C\) passes through \(\sigma\) in the preferred direction. This gives the intersections of dual paths and surfaces positive weight. 
\end{itemize}

To visualize a smoothed multi-path and its smoothed dual surface, sheath the infinitesimal path fibers in a cylinder. The path fibers are parallel to the sides of the cylinder, and are perpendicular to the end caps. The dual surfaces are perpendicular to the sides of the cylinder and are parallel to the end caps. The total path weight passing through the cylinder is proportional to the cross-sectional area of the cylinder, while the total surface weight slicing through the cylinder is proportional to its length.

In the image below, the leftmost cylinders contain a path with a total weight of \(w_{\parallel}\), and a surface with a total weight of \(w_{\perp}\). These paths and surfaces are dual to each other. In the top row of images, when the cylinder decreases in length, the contained surface weight decreases proportionally, while the contained path weight remains constant. In the bottom row of images, when the cylinder decreases in cross-sectional area, the contained path weight decreases proportionally, while the contained surface weight remains constant. 

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width = 0.9\textwidth]{Duality/path_surface_duality_2}
\end{center}

To determine the multi-path \(\mathbf{J}\) that is dual to a multi-surface \(\mathbf{F}\), break the multi-surface \(\mathbf{F}\) into infinitesimal sections with equal weight and area, replace each section of surface with its dual path, and lastly stitch the path segments together leaving as little endpoints as possible. While there is no unique way of performing this process, once ``smoothing" has been applied none of this matters.  

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width = 0.9\textwidth]{Duality/path_surface_duality_3}
\end{center}

Given a multi-surface \(\mathbf{F}\), the multi-path \(\mathbf{J}\) that is ``dual" to \(\mathbf{F}\) will be denoted via the notation:
\[\mathbf{J} = \epsilon(\mathbf{F})\]
or conversely, 
\[\mathbf{F} = \epsilon^{-1}(\mathbf{J})\]

The following is important to note:
\begin{itemize}
\item The dual of the union is the union of the duals:
\[\epsilon(\mathbf{F}_1 + \mathbf{F}_2) = \epsilon(\mathbf{F}_1) + \epsilon(\mathbf{F}_2)
\quad\quad\text{and}\quad\quad
\epsilon^{-1}(\mathbf{J}_1 + \mathbf{J}_2) = \epsilon^{-1}(\mathbf{J}_1) + \epsilon^{-1}(\mathbf{J}_2)\]
If \(c\) is an arbitrary real valued coefficient, then:
\[\epsilon(c \cdot \mathbf{F}) = c \cdot \epsilon(\mathbf{F})
\quad\quad\text{and}\quad\quad
\epsilon^{-1}(c \cdot \mathbf{J}) = c \cdot \epsilon^{-1}(\mathbf{J})\]
\end{itemize}



\section{Duality and intersections}

\begin{thm}
Given multi-point \(\rho\) and multi-volume \(V\), 

\[\iota^{-1}(\rho \cdot V) = \iota^{-1}(\rho) \cdot V\]

Given multi-point \(\mathbf{J}\) and multi-volume \(V\), 

\[\epsilon^{-1}(\mathbf{J} \cdot V) = \epsilon^{-1}(\mathbf{J}) \cdot V\]

Given multi-surface \(\mathbf{F}\) and multi-volume \(V\), 

\[\epsilon(\mathbf{F} \cdot V) = \epsilon(\mathbf{F}) \cdot V\]

Given multi-volume \(U\) and multi-volume \(V\), 

\[\iota(U \cdot V) = \iota(U) \cdot V\]
\end{thm}


\begin{tabular}{cc}
\parbox{0.5\textwidth}{
\begin{thm}\label{thm:point-volume_intersection_duality}
Given multi-volumes \(U\) and \(V\), 
\[\iota(U) \cdot V = U \cdot \iota(V)\]
\end{thm}
\textbf{Proof:}

Let \(u\) and \(v\) be infinitesimally small single volumes with weights of \(1\), and whose volumes are equivalent. There are two scenarios. In the first scenario, \(\iota(u)\) and \(\iota(v)\) are at different positions. In the second scenario, \(\iota(u) = \iota(v)\). These scenarios are depicted on the right.

\begin{itemize}
\item In case 1, \(\iota(u) \cdot v = 0\) and \(u \cdot \iota(v) = 0\) so \(\iota(u) \cdot v = u \cdot \iota(v)\). 
\item In case 2, \(\iota(u) = \iota(v)\) implies \(u = v\). Therefore \(\iota(u) \cdot v = u \cdot \iota(v)\).  
\end{itemize}
} & \parbox{0.5\textwidth}{
\includegraphics[width = 0.5\textwidth]{Duality/point_volume_duality_intersection}

\end{tabular}

For infinitesimal single volumes \(u\) and \(v\) with equal volumes and weights of \(1\), \(\iota(u) \cdot v = u \cdot \iota(v)\). Generalizing to non-infinitesimal scales, let \(U\) and \(V\) denote non-infinitesimal volumes comprised of infinitesimal volumes:
\[U = u_1 + u_2 + ... + u_{\infty}\] 
\[V = v_1 + v_2 + ... + v_{\infty}\]
Next:
\begin{align*}
\iota(U) \cdot V
= & \iota(u_1 + u_2 + ... + u_{\infty}) \cdot (v_1 + v_2 + ... + v_{\infty}) \\
= & (\iota(u_1) + \iota(u_2) + ... + \iota(u_{\infty})) \cdot (v_1 + v_2 + ... + v_{\infty}) \\  
= & \quad \iota(u_1) \cdot v_1 + \iota(u_1) \cdot v_2 + ... + \iota(u_1) \cdot v_\infty \\  
& + \iota(u_2) \cdot v_1 + \iota(u_2) \cdot v_2 + ... + \iota(u_2) \cdot v_\infty \\  
& ... \\
& + \iota(u_\infty) \cdot v_1 + \iota(u_\infty) \cdot v_2 + ... + \iota(u_\infty) \cdot v_\infty   
\end{align*}
\begin{align*}
= & \quad u_1 \cdot \iota(v_1) + u_1 \cdot \iota(v_2) + ... + u_1 \cdot \iota(v_\infty) \\ 
& + u_2 \cdot \iota(v_1) + u_2 \cdot \iota(v_2) + ... + u_2 \cdot \iota(v_\infty) \\ 
& ... \\ 
& + u_\infty \cdot \iota(v_1) + u_\infty \cdot \iota(v_2) + ... + u_\infty \cdot \iota(v_\infty) \\ 
= & (u_1 + u_2 + ... + u_\infty) \cdot (\iota(v_1) + \iota(v_2) + ... + \iota(v_\infty)) \\ 
= & (u_1 + u_2 + ... + u_\infty) \cdot \iota(v_1 + v_2 + ... + v_\infty) \\ 
= & U \cdot \iota(V)
\end{align*}
Therefore:
\[\iota(U) \cdot V = U \cdot \iota(V)\]
\(\Box\)

\begin{thm}\label{thm:path-surface_intersection_duality}
Given multi-surfaces \(\mathbf{F}\) and \(\mathbf{G}\),

\end{thm}
\textbf{Proof:}

Let \(\mathbf{f}\) and \(\mathbf{g}\) be infinitesimally small surfaces with weights of \(w_{\perp}\). Let the dual paths \(\epsilon(\mathbf{f})\) and \(\epsilon(\mathbf{g})\) have weights of \(w_{\parallel}\). There are two scenarios. In the first scenario, \(\mathbf{f}\) and \(\mathbf{g}\) are at different positions. In the second scenario, \(\mathbf{f}\) and \(\mathbf{g}\) are at the same position. These scenarios are depicted on the right.

\begin{itemize}
\item In case 1, \(\epsilon(\mathbf{f}) \bullet \mathbf{g} = 0\) and \(\mathbf{f} \bullet \epsilon(\mathbf{g}) = 0\) so \(\epsilon(\mathbf{f}) \bullet \mathbf{g} = \mathbf{f} \bullet \epsilon(\mathbf{g})\). 
\item In case 2, the intersection point \(\epsilon(\mathbf{f}) \bullet \mathbf{g}\) has a weight of \(w_{\parallel} w_{\perp}\). The intersection point \(\mathbf{f} \bullet \epsilon(\mathbf{g})\) also has a weight of \(w_{\parallel} w_{\perp}\), and has the same position. Therefore \(\epsilon(\mathbf{f}) \bullet \mathbf{g} = \mathbf{f} \bullet \epsilon(\mathbf{g})\).

For infinitesimal surfaces \(\mathbf{f}\) and \(\mathbf{g}\) with equal weights, \(\epsilon(\mathbf{f}) \bullet \mathbf{g} = \mathbf{f} \bullet \epsilon(\mathbf{g})\). Generalizing to non-infinitesimal scales, let \(\mathbf{F}\) and \(\mathbf{G}\) denote non-infinitesimal volumes comprised of infinitesimal volumes:

& + \epsilon(\mathbf{f}_\infty) \bullet \mathbf{g}_1 + \epsilon(\mathbf{f}_\infty) \bullet \mathbf{g}_2 + ... + \epsilon(\mathbf{f}_\infty) \bullet \mathbf{g}_\infty

\begin{align*}
= & \quad \mathbf{f}_1 \bullet \epsilon(\mathbf{g}_1) + \mathbf{f}_1 \bullet \epsilon(\mathbf{g}_2) + ... + \mathbf{f}_1 \bullet \epsilon(\mathbf{g}_\infty) \\

Therefore:
\[\epsilon(\mathbf{F}) \bullet \mathbf{G} = \mathbf{F} \bullet \epsilon(\mathbf{G})\]

\section{Simplifying notation}

In the discussions that will follow, duality conversions will begin to happen rapidly, and to avoid notational clutter, the following abbreviations will be made:

\begin{itemize}
%%%%%
\item Given multi-points \(\rho_1\) and \(\rho_2\), the expression \(\rho_1 \cdot \rho_2\) will be defined by  
\[\rho_1 \cdot \rho_2 = \iota^{-1}(\rho_1) \cdot \rho_2 = \rho_1 \cdot \iota^{-1}(\rho_2)\]
Thanks to theorem \ref{thm:point-volume_intersection_duality}, \(\iota^{-1}(\rho_1) \cdot \rho_2 = \rho_1 \cdot \iota^{-1}(\rho_2)\)
%%%%%
\item Given multi-point \(\rho\) and multi-path \(\mathbf{J}\), the expression \(\rho \cdot \mathbf{J}\) will be defined by
\[\rho \cdot \mathbf{J} = \iota^{-1}(\rho) \cdot \mathbf{J}\]
%%%%%
\item Given multi-point \(\rho\) and multi-surface \(\mathbf{F}\), the expression \(\rho \cdot \mathbf{F}\) will be defined by
\[\rho \cdot \mathbf{F} = \iota^{-1}(\rho) \cdot \mathbf{F}\]
%%%%%
\item Given multi-paths \(\mathbf{J}_1\) and \(\mathbf{J}_2\), the expression \(\mathbf{J}_1 \bullet \mathbf{J}_2\) will be defined by 
\[\mathbf{J}_1 \bullet \mathbf{J}_2 = \epsilon^{-1}(\mathbf{J}_1) \bullet \mathbf{J}_2 = \mathbf{J}_1 \bullet \epsilon^{-1}(\mathbf{J}_2)\]
Thanks to theorem \ref{thm:path-surface_intersection_duality}, \(\epsilon^{-1}(\mathbf{J}_1) \bullet \mathbf{J}_2 = \mathbf{J}_1 \bullet \epsilon^{-1}(\mathbf{J}_2)\)
%%%%%
\item Given multi-surfaces \(\mathbf{F}_1\) and \(\mathbf{F}_2\), the expression \(\mathbf{F}_1 \bullet \mathbf{F}_2\) will be defined by 
\[\mathbf{F}_1 \bullet \mathbf{F}_2 = \epsilon(\mathbf{F}_1) \bullet \mathbf{F}_2 = \mathbf{F}_1 \bullet \epsilon(\mathbf{F}_2)\]
Thanks to theorem \ref{thm:path-surface_intersection_duality}, \(\epsilon(\mathbf{F}_1) \bullet \mathbf{F}_2 = \mathbf{F}_1 \bullet \epsilon(\mathbf{F}_2)\)
%%%%%
\item Given multi-paths \(\mathbf{J}_1\) and \(\mathbf{J}_2\), the expression \(\mathbf{J}_1 \times \mathbf{J}_2\) will be defined by 
\[\mathbf{J}_1 \times \mathbf{J}_2 = \epsilon^{-1}(\mathbf{J}_1) \times \epsilon^{-1}(\mathbf{J}_2)\]
%%%%%
\item Given multi-path \(\mathbf{J}\) and multi-surface \(\mathbf{F}\), the expression \(\mathbf{J} \times \mathbf{F}\) will be defined by 
\[\mathbf{J} \times \mathbf{F} = \epsilon^{-1}(\mathbf{J}) \times \mathbf{F}\]
%%%%%
\item Given multi-surface \(\mathbf{F}\) and multi-path \(\mathbf{J}\), the expression \(\mathbf{F} \times \mathbf{J}\) will be defined by 
\[\mathbf{F} \times \mathbf{J} = \mathbf{F} \times \epsilon^{-1}(\mathbf{J})\]
%%%%%
\item Given multi-point \(\rho\), the expression \(\nabla \rho\) will be defined by 
\[\nabla \rho = \nabla \iota^{-1}(\rho)\]
%%%%%
\item Given multi-path \(\mathbf{J}\), the expression \(\nabla \times \mathbf{J}\) will be defined by 
\[\nabla \times \mathbf{J} = \nabla \times \epsilon^{-1}(\mathbf{J})\]
%%%%%
\item Given multi-surface \(\mathbf{F}\), the expression \(\nabla \bullet \mathbf{F}\) will be defined by 
\[\nabla \bullet \mathbf{F} = \nabla \bullet \epsilon(\mathbf{F})\]
\item Given multi-volume \(U\), the expression \(\int U\) will be defined by
\[\int U = \int \iota(U)\]
This expression computes the total volume of \(U\).
\end{itemize}

{\bf In summary, if an operation cannot be performed, compute the dual of one (or both) of the operands until the operation is possible.}



\section{Quantifying duality}

Now that the concept of duality has been established, the relationship between the functions that quantify dual multi-structures is now to be addressed. 

Firstly, consider a multi-volume \(U\) quantified by the function \(U(\mathbf{q})\), and the dual multi-point \(\rho = \iota(U)\). The function \(\rho(\mathbf{q})\) that quantifies \(\rho\) is exactly the same as the function that quantifies \(U\): 

For all positions \(\mathbf{q}\),
\[\rho(\mathbf{q}) = U(\mathbf{q})\]

{\bf The relationship between multi-surfaces and their dual multi-paths is far less trivial however.} Let \(\mathbf{D}\) be a multi-path, and \(\mathbf{E}\) be the dual multi-surface: \(\mathbf{D} = \epsilon(\mathbf{E})\). If \(\mathbf{D}(\mathbf{q}) = \begin{bmatrix} D_1(\mathbf{q}) \\ D_2(\mathbf{q}) \\ D_3(\mathbf{q}) \end{bmatrix}\) is the vector valued function that quantifies \(\mathbf{D}\) and \(\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{q}) = \begin{bmatrix} E_1(\mathbf{q}) \\ E_2(\mathbf{q}) \\ E_3(\mathbf{q}) \end{bmatrix}\) is the vector valued function that quantifies \(\mathbf{E}\), then for all positions \(\mathbf{q}\), 

\[\left\{\begin{array}{c} 
D_1(\mathbf{q}) = \epsilon_{1,1}(\mathbf{q})E_1(\mathbf{q}) + \epsilon_{1,2}(\mathbf{q})E_2(\mathbf{q}) + \epsilon_{1,3}(\mathbf{q})E_3(\mathbf{q}) = \sum_j \epsilon_{1,j}(\mathbf{q})E_j(\mathbf{q}) \\ 
D_2(\mathbf{q}) = \epsilon_{2,1}(\mathbf{q})E_1(\mathbf{q}) + \epsilon_{2,2}(\mathbf{q})E_2(\mathbf{q}) + \epsilon_{2,3}(\mathbf{q})E_3(\mathbf{q}) = \sum_j \epsilon_{2,j}(\mathbf{q})E_j(\mathbf{q}) \\ 
D_3(\mathbf{q}) = \epsilon_{3,1}(\mathbf{q})E_1(\mathbf{q}) + \epsilon_{3,2}(\mathbf{q})E_2(\mathbf{q}) + \epsilon_{3,3}(\mathbf{q})E_3(\mathbf{q}) = \sum_j \epsilon_{3,j}(\mathbf{q})E_j(\mathbf{q}) 
\end{array}\right.\]

Where all of the \(\epsilon_{i,j}(\mathbf{q})\) are coefficients that quantify the relationship \(\mathbf{D} = \epsilon(\mathbf{E})\).

This relationship can be abbreviated using ``matrix form": 
\[\begin{bmatrix} D_1(\mathbf{q}) \\ D_2(\mathbf{q}) \\ D_3(\mathbf{q}) \end{bmatrix} 
= \begin{bmatrix}
\epsilon_{1,1}(\mathbf{q}) & \epsilon_{1,2}(\mathbf{q}) & \epsilon_{1,3}(\mathbf{q}) \\ 
\epsilon_{2,1}(\mathbf{q}) & \epsilon_{2,2}(\mathbf{q}) & \epsilon_{2,3}(\mathbf{q}) \\ 
\epsilon_{3,1}(\mathbf{q}) & \epsilon_{3,2}(\mathbf{q}) & \epsilon_{3,3}(\mathbf{q}) 
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix} E_1(\mathbf{q}) \\ E_2(\mathbf{q}) \\ E_3(\mathbf{q}) \end{bmatrix}\]  

In order for the relationship \(\epsilon(\mathbf{F}) \bullet \mathbf{G} = \mathbf{F} \bullet \epsilon(\mathbf{G})\) to hold, the matrix must be ``symmetric":
\[\epsilon_{1,2}(\mathbf{q}) = \epsilon_{2,1}(\mathbf{q}) \quad\quad\text{and}\quad\quad 
\epsilon_{1,3}(\mathbf{q}) = \epsilon_{3,1}(\mathbf{q}) \quad\quad\text{and}\quad\quad 
\epsilon_{2,3}(\mathbf{q}) = \epsilon_{3,2}(\mathbf{q})\] 

All of the coefficients have units of \(\text{m}^{-1}\).



\section{Energy}

\subsection{Path energy}

Given a multi-path \(\mathbf{D}\), the ``energy" of \(\mathbf{D}\) is \(1/2\) the total number of intersections that the path has with its own dual:

\[E = \frac{1}{2}\int (\mathbf{D} \bullet \mathbf{D}) = \frac{1}{2}\int (\mathbf{D} \bullet \epsilon^{-1}(\mathbf{D}))\]

The multiplier of \(\frac{1}{2}\) exists to remain consistent with physics.

The energy is always strictly positive except for the \(0\) multi-path where the energy is \(0\).


\subsection{Surface energy}

Given a multi-surface \(\mathbf{E}\), the ``energy" of \(\mathbf{E}\) is \(1/2\) the total number of intersections that the surface has with its own dual:

\[E = \frac{1}{2}\int (\mathbf{E} \bullet \mathbf{E}) = \frac{1}{2}\int (\epsilon(\mathbf{E}) \bullet \mathbf{E})\]

Again, the multiplier of \(\frac{1}{2}\) exists to remain consistent with physics.

The energy is always strictly positive except for the \(0\) multi-surface where the energy is \(0\).


\subsection{Loop-bubble duality}


If a multi-bubble is dual to a multi-loop, then both are \(0\). This can be proven from  the fact that the energy of a nonzero path or surface is always positive. 

\begin{thm}\label{thm:loop_bubble_duality}
Assume that \(\mathbf{E}\) is a multi-bubble: \(\nabla \times \mathbf{E} = 0\). Also assume that the dual multi-path \(\mathbf{D} = \epsilon(\mathbf{E})\) is also a multi-loop: \(\nabla \bullet \mathbf{D} = 0\). It must then be the case that \(\mathbf{E} = 0\) and \(\mathbf{D} = 0\).
\end{thm}
\textbf{Proof:}

\vspace{5mm}

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{cc}
\parbox{0.5\textwidth}{
Since \(\mathbf{E}\) is a multi-bubble, there must exist some multi-volume \(U\) whose inwards oriented surface is \(\mathbf{E}\). 

The energy of both \(\mathbf{D}\) and \(\mathbf{E}\) is:

\begin{align*}
E = & \frac{1}{2}\int (\mathbf{D} \bullet \mathbf{E}) 
= \frac{1}{2} \int (\mathbf{D} \bullet (\nabla U)) 
\end{align*} 

As established by theorem \ref{thm:gradient_theorem}, the number of times \(\mathbf{D}\) enters \(U\) is the total number of finishing points \(\mathbf{D}\) leaves in \(U\) so: 
\[\int (\mathbf{D} \bullet (\nabla U)) = -\int ((\nabla \bullet \mathbf{D}) U)\] 
therefore continuing the derivation yields:

\begin{align*}
E = & \frac{1}{2} \int (\mathbf{D} \bullet (\nabla U)) 
= -\frac{1}{2} \int ((\nabla \bullet \mathbf{D}) U) 
= -\frac{1}{2} \int (0 \cdot U) 
= 0
\end{align*}

The energy is \(0\), and this only occurs if \(\mathbf{D} = 0\) and \(\mathbf{E} = 0\). {\bf Non-zero multi-bubbles can never be dual to a multi-loop and vice versa. \(\Box\)}
} & \parbox{0.5\textwidth}{
\includegraphics[width = 0.5\textwidth]{Duality/loop_bubble_duality}
}
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

A consequence of this fact is that if two path-surface pairs have the same end-points and counterclockwise boundaries, then they are equivalent: 

\textbf{Corollary:}

Let \(\mathbf{D}_1\) and \(\mathbf{E}_1\) be a multi-path and a multi-surface pair that are dual to each other: \(\mathbf{D}_1 = \epsilon(\mathbf{E}_1)\)

Let \(\mathbf{D}_2\) and \(\mathbf{E}_2\) also be a multi-path and a multi-surface pair that are dual to each other: \(\mathbf{D}_2 = \epsilon(\mathbf{E}_2)\)

If \(\nabla \bullet \mathbf{D}_1 = \nabla \bullet \mathbf{D}_2\) and \(\nabla \times \mathbf{E}_1 = \nabla \times \mathbf{E}_2\), then \(\mathbf{D}_1 = \mathbf{D}_2\) and \(\mathbf{E}_1 = \mathbf{E}_2\).   

\textbf{Proof:}

Let \(\mathbf{D}_{\text{loop}} = \mathbf{D}_1 - \mathbf{D}_2\). \(\mathbf{D}_{\text{loop}}\) is a multi-loop:
\[\nabla \bullet \mathbf{D}_{\text{loop}} = \nabla \bullet (\mathbf{D}_1 - \mathbf{D}_2) = \nabla \bullet \mathbf{D}_1 - \nabla \bullet \mathbf{D}_2 = 0\]

Let \(\mathbf{E}_{\text{bubble}} = \mathbf{E}_1 - \mathbf{E}_2\). \(\mathbf{E}_{\text{bubble}}\) is a multi-bubble: 
\[\nabla \times \mathbf{E}_{\text{bubble}} = \nabla \times (\mathbf{E}_1 - \mathbf{E}_2) = \nabla \times \mathbf{E}_1 - \nabla \times \mathbf{E}_2 = 0\]

\(\mathbf{D}_{\text{loop}}\) and \(\mathbf{E}_{\text{bubble}}\) are a dual pair:
\[\epsilon(\mathbf{E}_{\text{bubble}}) = \epsilon(\mathbf{E}_1 - \mathbf{E}_2) = \epsilon(\mathbf{E}_1) - \epsilon(\mathbf{E}_2) = \mathbf{D}_1 - \mathbf{D}_2 = \mathbf{D}_{\text{loop}}\]

From theorem \ref{thm:loop_bubble_duality}, \(\mathbf{D}_{\text{loop}} = 0\) and \(\mathbf{E}_{\text{bubble}} = 0\). Therefore \(\mathbf{D}_1 = \mathbf{D}_2\) and \(\mathbf{E}_1 = \mathbf{E}_2\). \(\Box\)



\subsection{Low energy multi-path}

Given a balanced multi-point \(\rho\), it is known via theorem \ref{thm:dot-to-dot} from section \ref{sec:balanced_multi-points} that there must exist a multi-path \(\mathbf{D}\) such that \(\nabla \bullet \mathbf{D} = \rho\). However, the choice of \(\mathbf{D}\) is {\bf not unique}. A unique choice of multi-path \(\mathbf{D}\) is the choice that minimizes the energy \(\frac{1}{2}\int (\mathbf{D} \bullet \mathbf{D})\). It will now be demonstrated that the energy minimizing choice is both unique and is dual to a multi-bubble:

\begin{thm}\label{thm:low_energy_path}
Given a balanced multi-point \(\rho\), the multi-path \(\mathbf{D}\) that satisfies \(\nabla \bullet \mathbf{D} = \rho\) and minimizes the energy \(\frac{1}{2}\int (\mathbf{D} \bullet \epsilon^{-1}(\mathbf{D}))\) is both {\bf unique} and is dual to a multi-bubble: i.e. \(\nabla \times \epsilon^{-1}(\mathbf{D}) = 0\). 
\end{thm}
\textbf{Proof:}

Let \(\mathbf{D}\) denote any multi-path whose endpoints are \(\rho\): \(\nabla \bullet \mathbf{D} = \rho\). It will be demonstrated that unless \(\nabla \times \mathbf{D} = 0\), that there will exist another multi-path \(\mathbf{D}_{\text{next}}\) whose endpoints are also \(\rho\): \(\nabla \bullet \mathbf{D}_{\text{next}} = \rho\), and has a lower energy than \(\mathbf{D}\). 

The approach that will be used here is referred to as the {\bf method of variations}. The method of variations involves proposing a change to \(\mathbf{D}\), and then determining conditions such that no changes result in lower energy. Choose any multi-surface \(\mathbf{F}\), referred to as a ``test surface". The boundary \(\nabla \times \mathbf{F}\) is a closed loop, and adding any multiple of \(\nabla \times \mathbf{F}\) to \(\mathbf{D}\) does not change the endpoints.

Let \(t\) be a small number (that is close to 0), and then propose the change:
\[\mathbf{D}_{\text{new}} = \mathbf{D} + t(\nabla \times \mathbf{F})\]
The endpoints are unchanged:
\begin{align*}
\nabla \bullet \mathbf{D}_{\text{new}} = & \nabla \bullet \mathbf{D} + t(\nabla \bullet (\nabla \times \mathbf{F})) \\ 
= & \nabla \bullet \mathbf{D} - t(0) 
= \rho
\end{align*}

The current energy is \(E_{\text{old}} = \frac{1}{2}\int (\mathbf{D} \bullet \mathbf{D})\)

The new energy is: 

\begin{align*}
E_{\text{new}} = & \frac{1}{2}\int (\mathbf{D}_{\text{new}} \bullet \mathbf{D}_{\text{new}}) \\ 
= & \frac{1}{2}\int (\mathbf{D} + t (\nabla \times \mathbf{F})) \bullet (\mathbf{D} + t (\nabla \times \mathbf{F})) \\ 
= & \frac{1}{2}\int (\mathbf{D} \bullet \mathbf{D} + t(\mathbf{D} \bullet (\nabla \times \mathbf{F}) + (\nabla \times \mathbf{F}) \bullet \mathbf{D}) + t^2((\nabla \times \mathbf{F}) \bullet (\nabla \times \mathbf{F}))) \\
= & \frac{1}{2}\int (\mathbf{D} \bullet \mathbf{D}) + t\int (\mathbf{D} \bullet (\nabla \times \mathbf{F})) + \frac{t^2}{2}\int ((\nabla \times \mathbf{F}) \bullet (\nabla \times \mathbf{F})) \\ 
= & E_{\text{old}} + t\int (\mathbf{D} \bullet (\nabla \times \mathbf{F})) + \frac{t^2}{2}\int ((\nabla \times \mathbf{F}) \bullet (\nabla \times \mathbf{F}))
\end{align*}

Of interest is the term \(\int (\mathbf{D} \bullet (\nabla \times \mathbf{F}))\). If this term is \(0\), then no choice of \(t\) results in lower energy. Contrariwise, if this term is non-zero, then \(t\) can be chosen to decrease the energy further. 

\(\int (\mathbf{D} \bullet (\nabla \times \mathbf{F}))\) is the total point weight of the intersection of the surface \(\epsilon^{-1}(\mathbf{D})\) with the counterclockwise boundary of \(\mathbf{F}\). Using Stokes' theorem (theorem \ref{thm:stokes_theorem}), 
\begin{align*}
& \int (\mathbf{D} \bullet (\nabla \times \mathbf{F})) = 0
\iff \int ((\nabla \times \mathbf{D}) \bullet \mathbf{F}) = 0 
\iff \int ((\nabla \times \mathbf{D}) \bullet \mathbf{F}) = \int (0 \bullet \mathbf{F}) 
\end{align*}

The energy cannot be reduced further if and only if \(\int (\mathbf{D} \bullet (\nabla \times \mathbf{F})) = 0\) for every choice of test surface \(\mathbf{F}\). Equivalently, the energy cannot be reduced further if and only if \(\int ((\nabla \times \mathbf{D}) \bullet \mathbf{F}) = \int (0 \bullet \mathbf{F})\) for every choice of test surface \(\mathbf{F}\).

Treat \(\mathbf{F}\) as a ``scanning window" from theorem \ref{thm:scanning_paths}. From this theorem, \(\int ((\nabla \times \mathbf{D}) \bullet \mathbf{F}) = \int (0 \bullet \mathbf{F})\) for every choice of scanning window \(\mathbf{F}\) if and only if \(\nabla \times \mathbf{D} = 0\). The energy cannot be reduced further if and only if \(\mathbf{D}\) is dual to a multi-bubble: i.e. \(\nabla \times \mathbf{D} = 0\).

It lastly needs to be demonstrated that the optimal choice of \(\mathbf{D}\) is unique. Let \(\mathbf{D}_1\) and \(\mathbf{D}_2\) denote two optimal choices of \(\mathbf{D}\). This means that \(\nabla \bullet \mathbf{D}_1 = \nabla \bullet \mathbf{D}_2 = \rho\) and \(\nabla \times \epsilon^{-1}(\mathbf{D}_1) = \nabla \times \epsilon^{-1}(\mathbf{D}_2) = 0\). From the corollary of theorem \ref{thm:loop_bubble_duality}, \(\mathbf{D}_1 = \mathbf{D}_2\). \(\Box\) 

\textbf{Corollary:}

Given the balanced multi-points \(\rho_1\) and \(\rho_2\), if \(\mathbf{D}_1\) and \(\mathbf{D}_2\) are the minimum energy multi-paths that satisfy \(\nabla \bullet \mathbf{D}_1 = \rho_1\) and \(\nabla \bullet \mathbf{D}_2 = \rho_2\), then \(\mathbf{D}_{1+2} = \mathbf{D}_1 + \mathbf{D}_2\) is the minimum energy multi-path that satisfies \(\nabla \bullet \mathbf{D}_{1+2} = \rho_1 + \rho_2\). Moreover, given any real number \(c\), \(\mathbf{D}_{c1} = c \cdot \mathbf{D}_1\) is the minimum energy multi-path that satisfies \(\nabla \bullet \mathbf{D}_{c1} = c \cdot \rho_1\).

\textbf{Proof:}

Firstly, 
\[\nabla \bullet \mathbf{D}_{1+2} = \nabla \bullet \mathbf{D}_1 + \nabla \bullet \mathbf{D}_2 = \rho_1 + \rho_2\]
and 
\[\nabla \bullet \mathbf{D}_{c1} = c \cdot (\nabla \bullet \mathbf{D}_1) = c \cdot \rho_1\]
so \(\mathbf{D}_{1+2}\) and \(\mathbf{D}_{c1}\) satisfy their respective equations.

From theorem \ref{thm:low_energy_path}, \(\mathbf{D}_1\) and \(\mathbf{D}_2\) are multi-bubbles, and \(\mathbf{D}_{1+2}\) and \(\mathbf{D}_{c1}\) must be multi-bubbles to be minimum energy multi-paths. 
\[\nabla \times \mathbf{D}_{1+2} = \nabla \times (\mathbf{D}_1 + \mathbf{D}_2) = \nabla \times \mathbf{D}_1 + \nabla \times \mathbf{D}_2 = 0 + 0 = 0\]
and 
\[\nabla \times \mathbf{D}_{c1} = \nabla \times (c \cdot \mathbf{D}_1) = c \cdot (\nabla \times \mathbf{D}_1) = c \cdot 0 = 0\]
Therefore \(\mathbf{D}_{1+2}\) and \(\mathbf{D}_{c1}\) are multi-bubbles and are hence minimum energy multi-paths. \(\Box\)

\subsection{Low energy multi-surface}

Given a multi-loop \(\mathbf{J}\), it is known via theorem \ref{thm:filling_closed_loops} from section \ref{sec:closed_loops} that there must exist a multi-surface \(\mathbf{E}\) such that \(\nabla \times \mathbf{E} = \mathbf{J}\). However, the choice of \(\mathbf{E}\) is {\bf not unique}. A unique choice of multi-surface \(\mathbf{E}\) is the choice that minimizes the energy \(\frac{1}{2}\int (\mathbf{E} \bullet \mathbf{E})\). It will now be demonstrated that the energy minimizing choice is both unique and is dual to a multi-loop:

\begin{thm}\label{thm:low_energy_surface}
Given a multi-loop \(\mathbf{J}\), the multi-surface \(\mathbf{E}\) that satisfies \(\nabla \times \mathbf{E} = \mathbf{J}\) and minimizes the energy \(\frac{1}{2}\int (\epsilon(\mathbf{E}) \bullet \mathbf{E})\) is both {\bf unique} and is dual to a multi-loop: i.e. \(\nabla \bullet \epsilon(\mathbf{E}) = 0\). 
\end{thm}
\textbf{Proof:}

Let \(\mathbf{E}\) denote any multi-surface whose boundary is \(\mathbf{J}\): \(\nabla \times \mathbf{E} = \mathbf{J}\). It will be demonstrated that unless \(\nabla \bullet \mathbf{E} = 0\), that there will exist another multi-surface \(\mathbf{E}_{\text{next}}\) whose boundary is also \(\mathbf{J}\): \(\nabla \times \mathbf{E}_{\text{next}} = \mathbf{J}\), and has a lower energy than \(\mathbf{E}\). 

The approach that will be used here is referred to as the {\bf method of variations}. The method of variations involves proposing a change to \(\mathbf{E}\), and then determining conditions such that no changes result in lower energy. Choose any multi-volume \(U\), referred to as a ``test volume". The surface \(\nabla U\) is a closed surface, and adding any multiple of \(\nabla U\) to \(\mathbf{E}\) does not change the boundary.

Let \(t\) be a small number (that is close to 0), and then propose the change:
\[\mathbf{E}_{\text{new}} = \mathbf{E} + t(\nabla U)\]
The boundary is unchanged:
\begin{align*}
\nabla \times \mathbf{E}_{\text{new}} = & \nabla \times \mathbf{E} + t(\nabla \times (\nabla U)) \\ 
= & \nabla \times \mathbf{E} - t(0) 
= \mathbf{J}
\end{align*}

The current energy is \(E_{\text{old}} = \frac{1}{2}\int (\mathbf{E} \bullet \mathbf{E})\)

The new energy is: 

\begin{align*}
E_{\text{new}} = & \frac{1}{2}\int (\mathbf{E}_{\text{new}} \bullet \mathbf{E}_{\text{new}}) \\ 
= & \frac{1}{2}\int (\mathbf{E} + t (\nabla U)) \bullet (\mathbf{E} + t (\nabla U)) \\ 
= & \frac{1}{2}\int (\mathbf{E} \bullet \mathbf{E} + t(\mathbf{E} \bullet (\nabla U) + (\nabla U) \bullet \mathbf{E}) + t^2((\nabla U) \bullet (\nabla U))) \\
= & \frac{1}{2}\int (\mathbf{E} \bullet \mathbf{E}) + t\int (\mathbf{E} \bullet (\nabla U)) + \frac{t^2}{2}\int ((\nabla U) \bullet (\nabla U)) \\ 
= & E_{\text{old}} + t\int (\mathbf{E} \bullet (\nabla U)) + \frac{t^2}{2}\int ((\nabla U) \bullet (\nabla U))
\end{align*}

Of interest is the term \(\int (\mathbf{E} \bullet (\nabla U))\). If this term is \(0\), then no choice of \(t\) results in lower energy. Contrariwise, if this term is non-zero, then \(t\) can be chosen to decrease the energy further. 

\(\int (\mathbf{E} \bullet (\nabla U))\) is the total point weight of the intersection of the path \(\epsilon(\mathbf{E})\) with the inwards oriented surface of \(U\). Using the gradient theorem (theorem \ref{thm:gradient_theorem}), 
\begin{align*}
& \int (\mathbf{E} \bullet (\nabla U)) = 0
\iff -\int ((\nabla \bullet \mathbf{E}) \cdot U) = 0 
\iff \int ((\nabla \bullet \mathbf{E}) \cdot U) = \int (0 \cdot U) 
\end{align*}

The energy cannot be reduced further if and only if \(\int (\mathbf{E} \bullet (\nabla U)) = 0\) for every choice of test volume \(U\). Equivalently, the energy cannot be reduced further if and only if \(\int ((\nabla \bullet \mathbf{E}) \cdot U) = \int (0 \cdot U)\) for every choice of test volume \(U\).

Treat \(U\) as a ``scanning window" from theorem \ref{thm:scanning_points}. From this theorem, \(\int ((\nabla \bullet \mathbf{E}) \cdot U) = \int (0 \cdot U)\) for every choice of scanning window \(U\) if and only if \(\nabla \bullet \mathbf{E} = 0\). The energy cannot be reduced further if and only if \(\mathbf{E}\) is dual to a multi-loop: i.e. \(\nabla \bullet \mathbf{E} = 0\).

It lastly needs to be demonstrated that the optimal choice of \(\mathbf{E}\) is unique. Let \(\mathbf{E}_1\) and \(\mathbf{E}_2\) denote two optimal choices of \(\mathbf{E}\). This means that \(\nabla \times \mathbf{E}_1 = \nabla \times \mathbf{E}_2 = \mathbf{J}\) and \(\nabla \bullet \epsilon(\mathbf{E}_1) = \nabla \bullet \epsilon(\mathbf{E}_2) = 0\). From the corollary of theorem \ref{thm:loop_bubble_duality}, \(\mathbf{E}_1 = \mathbf{E}_2\). \(\Box\) 

\textbf{Corollary:}

Given the multi-loops \(\mathbf{J}_1\) and \(\mathbf{J}_2\), if \(\mathbf{E}_1\) and \(\mathbf{E}_2\) are the minimum energy multi-surfaces that satisfy \(\nabla \times \mathbf{E}_1 = \mathbf{J}_1\) and \(\nabla \times \mathbf{E}_2 = \mathbf{J}_2\), then \(\mathbf{E}_{1+2} = \mathbf{E}_1 + \mathbf{E}_2\) is the minimum energy multi-surface that satisfies \(\nabla \times \mathbf{E}_{1+2} = \mathbf{J}_1 + \mathbf{J}_2\). Moreover, given any real number \(c\), \(\mathbf{E}_{c1} = c \cdot \mathbf{E}_1\) is the minimum energy multi-surface that satisfies \(\nabla \times \mathbf{E}_{c1} = c \cdot \mathbf{J}_1\).

\textbf{Proof:}

Firstly, 
\[\nabla \times \mathbf{E}_{1+2} = \nabla \times \mathbf{E}_1 + \nabla \times \mathbf{E}_2 = \mathbf{J}_1 + \mathbf{J}_2\]
and
\[\nabla \times \mathbf{E}_{c1} = c \cdot (\nabla \times \mathbf{E}_1) = c \cdot \mathbf{J}_1\]
so \(\mathbf{E}_{1+2}\) and \(\mathbf{E}_{c1}\) satisfy their respective equations.

From theorem \ref{thm:low_energy_surface}, \(\mathbf{E}_1\) and \(\mathbf{E}_2\) are multi-loops, and \(\mathbf{E}_{1+2}\) and \(\mathbf{E}_{c1}\) must be multi-loops to be minimum energy multi-surfaces. 
\[\nabla \bullet \mathbf{E}_{1+2} = \nabla \bullet (\mathbf{E}_1 + \mathbf{E}_2) = \nabla \bullet \mathbf{E}_1 + \nabla \bullet \mathbf{E}_2 = 0 + 0 = 0\]
and
\[\nabla \bullet \mathbf{E}_{c1} = \nabla \bullet (c \cdot \mathbf{E}_1) = c \cdot (\nabla \bullet \mathbf{E}_1) = c \cdot 0 = 0\]
Therefore \(\mathbf{E}_{1,2}\) and \(\mathbf{E}_{c1}\) are multi-loops and are hence minimum energy multi-surfaces. \(\Box\)



\subsection{The Helmholtz decomposition theorem}

\begin{thm}\label{thm:exactly_one_solution}   
Given an arbitrary balanced multi-point \(\rho\), and an arbitrary multi-loop \(\mathbf{J}\), then there exists a {\bf unique} multi-path \(\mathbf{D}\) with dual multi-surface \(\mathbf{E}\) such that \(\nabla \bullet \mathbf{D} = \rho\) and \(\nabla \times \mathbf{E} = \mathbf{J}\).
\end{thm}
\textbf{Proof:}

From theorem \ref{thm:low_energy_path}, there exists a unique multi-path \(\mathbf{D}_0\) such that \(\nabla \bullet \mathbf{D}_0 = \rho\) and \(\nabla \times \epsilon^{-1}(\mathbf{D}_0) = 0\). 

From theorem \ref{thm:low_energy_surface}, there exists a unique multi-surface \(\mathbf{E}_0\) such that \(\nabla \times \mathbf{E}_0 = \mathbf{J}\) and \(\nabla \bullet \epsilon(\mathbf{E}_0) = 0\). 

Let multi-path \(\mathbf{D} = \mathbf{D}_0 + \epsilon(\mathbf{E}_0)\) and multi-surface \(\mathbf{E} = \epsilon^{-1}(\mathbf{D}_0) + \mathbf{E}_0\). It is clear that \(\mathbf{D}\) and \(\mathbf{E}\) are dual to each other. It is also easy to confirm that:

\[\nabla \bullet \mathbf{D} = \nabla \bullet (\mathbf{D}_0 + \epsilon(\mathbf{E}_0)) = \nabla \bullet \mathbf{D}_0 + \nabla \bullet \epsilon(\mathbf{E}_0) = \rho + 0 = \rho\]      
and 
\[\nabla \times \mathbf{E} = \nabla \times (\epsilon^{-1}(\mathbf{D}_0) + \mathbf{E}_0) = \nabla \times \epsilon^{-1}(\mathbf{D}_0) + \nabla \times \mathbf{E}_0 = 0 + \mathbf{J} = \mathbf{J}\]

From the corollary of theorem \ref{thm:loop_bubble_duality}, \(\mathbf{D}\) and \(\mathbf{E}\) are unique. \(\Box\)


\begin{thm}\label{thm:helmholtz_decomposition_theorem} 
Given an arbitrary multi-path \(\mathbf{J}\), then there exists a {\bf unique} multi-loop \(\mathbf{D}\) (\(\nabla \bullet \mathbf{D} = 0\)) and a unique multi-bubble \(\mathbf{E}\) (\(\nabla \times \mathbf{E} = 0\)) such that \(\mathbf{J} = \mathbf{D} + \epsilon(\mathbf{E})\). This is referred to as the {\bf Helmholtz decomposition theorem}, which states that any multi-path or multi-surface is the sum of a multi-loop and a multi-bubble.
\end{thm}
\textbf{Proof:}

\(\nabla \bullet \mathbf{J}\) is a balanced multi-point. From theorem \ref{thm:low_energy_path}, let \(\mathbf{D}_{\text{bubble}}\) denote the unique multi-path such that \(\nabla \bullet \mathbf{D}_{\text{bubble}} = \nabla \bullet \mathbf{J}\) and \(\nabla \times \epsilon^{-1}(\mathbf{D}_{\text{bubble}}) = 0\).

Let \(\mathbf{D} = \mathbf{J} - \mathbf{D}_{\text{bubble}}\), and let \(\mathbf{E} = \epsilon^{-1}(\mathbf{D}_{\text{bubble}})\). It is already known that \(\mathbf{E}\) is a multi-bubble. Since \(\nabla \bullet \mathbf{D} = \nabla \bullet \mathbf{J} - \nabla \bullet \mathbf{D}_{\text{bubble}} = \nabla \bullet \mathbf{J} - \nabla \bullet \mathbf{J} = 0\), \(\mathbf{D}\) is a multi-loop. 

\(\mathbf{D}\) is a multi-loop and \(\mathbf{E}\) is a multi-bubble such that \(\mathbf{J} = \mathbf{D} + \epsilon(\mathbf{E})\). Since the choice of \(\mathbf{D}_{\text{bubble}}\) is unique, \(\mathbf{D}\) and \(\mathbf{E}\) are unique also. \(\Box\)



\section{Inductance}

\subsection{Balanced multi-point inductance}

\textbf{Self inductance}

Given a balanced multi-point \(\rho\), the ``self inductance" of \(\rho\), often denoted by \(L(\rho)\), is the \(2 \times\) the minimum possible energy of the multi-path whose endpoints are \(\rho\). If \(\mathbf{D}_{\text{min}}\) is the minimum energy multi-path that satisfies \(\nabla \bullet \mathbf{D}_{\text{min}} = \rho\), then 
\[L(\rho) = \int (\mathbf{D}_{\text{min}} \bullet \mathbf{D}_{\text{min}})\]  

If \(\mathbf{J}\) were an arbitrary multi-path whose endpoints are \(\rho\), \(\nabla \bullet \mathbf{J} = \rho\), then \(L(\rho)\) can also be interpreted as follows. Since \(\epsilon^{-1}(\mathbf{D}_{\text{min}})\) is a multi-bubble (see theorem \ref{thm:low_energy_path}) and \(\mathbf{D}_{\text{min}}\) and \(\mathbf{J}\) have the same endpoints, it then follows from theorem \ref{thm:different_paths_same_result} that 
\[L(\rho) = \int (\mathbf{D}_{\text{min}} \bullet \epsilon^{-1}(\mathbf{D}_{\text{min}})) = \int (\mathbf{J} \bullet \epsilon^{-1}(\mathbf{D}_{\text{min}}))\]
In other words, \(L(\rho)\) is the total number of surfaces from \(\epsilon^{-1}(\mathbf{D}_{\text{min}})\) that any path connecting the points from \(\rho\) will have to pass through.

\vspace{5mm}

\textbf{Mutual inductance}

Given two balanced multi-points \(\rho_1\) and \(\rho_2\), the ``mutual inductance" between \(\rho_1\) and \(\rho_2\), often demoted by \(M(\rho_1, \rho_2)\), is defined as follows. 
Let \(\mathbf{D}_{\text{min},1}\) be the minimum energy multi-path that satisfies \(\nabla \bullet \mathbf{D}_{\text{min},1} = \rho_1\).
Let \(\mathbf{D}_{\text{min},2}\) be the minimum energy multi-path that satisfies \(\nabla \bullet \mathbf{D}_{\text{min},2} = \rho_2\). 
The mutual inductance is 
\[M(\rho_1, \rho_2) = \int (\mathbf{D}_{\text{min},1} \bullet \mathbf{D}_{\text{min},2})\]
One immediate observation is that \(M(\rho_1, \rho_2) = M(\rho_2, \rho_1)\). It is also worth noting that \(L(\rho) = M(\rho,\rho)\).

If \(\mathbf{J}_1\) and \(\mathbf{J}_2\) are arbitrary multi-paths whose endpoints are \(\rho_1\) and \(\rho_2\) respectively, \(\nabla \bullet \mathbf{J}_1 = \rho_1\) and \(\nabla \bullet \mathbf{J}_2 = \rho_2\), then \(M(\rho_1, \rho_2)\) can be interpreted as follows. 

Since \(\epsilon^{-1}(\mathbf{D}_{\text{min},2})\) is a multi-bubble, it then follows from theorem \ref{thm:different_paths_same_result} that 
\[M(\rho_1, \rho_2) = \int (\mathbf{D}_{\text{min},1} \bullet \epsilon^{-1}(\mathbf{D}_{\text{min},2})) = \int (\mathbf{J}_1 \bullet \epsilon^{-1}(\mathbf{D}_{\text{min},2}))\]
In other words, \(M(\rho_1, \rho_2)\) is the total number of surfaces from \(\epsilon^{-1}(\mathbf{D}_{\text{min},2})\) that any path connecting the points from \(\rho_1\) will have to pass through.

Similarly, since \(\epsilon^{-1}(\mathbf{D}_{\text{min},1})\) is a multi-bubble, it then follows from theorem \ref{thm:different_paths_same_result} that 
\[M(\rho_1, \rho_2) = \int (\mathbf{D}_{\text{min},2} \bullet \epsilon^{-1}(\mathbf{D}_{\text{min},1})) = \int (\mathbf{J}_2 \bullet \epsilon^{-1}(\mathbf{D}_{\text{min},1}))\]
In other words, \(M(\rho_1, \rho_2)\) is the total number of surfaces from \(\epsilon^{-1}(\mathbf{D}_{\text{min},1})\) that any path connecting the points from \(\rho_2\) will have to pass through.

\vspace{5mm}

\textbf{Properties of the inductance}

\begin{thm}\label{thm:balanced_multi-point_inductance_properties}
Let \(\rho_1\), \(\rho_2\), and \(\rho_3\) be arbitrary balanced multi-points. Let \(c\) be an arbitrary real number. It is then the case that:

a)
\[M(\rho_1 + \rho_2, \rho_3) = M(\rho_1, \rho_3) + M(\rho_2, \rho_3)\]

b)
\[M(c \cdot \rho_1, \rho_3) = c \cdot M(\rho_1, \rho_3)\]

c)
\[L(\rho_1 + \rho_2) = L(\rho_1) + 2M(\rho_1, \rho_2) + L(\rho_2)\]

d)
\[L(c \cdot \rho_1) = c^2 \cdot L(\rho_1)\]
\end{thm}
\textbf{Proof:}

Let \(\mathbf{D}_1\), \(\mathbf{D}_2\), and \(\mathbf{D}_3\) be the minimum energy multi-paths that satisfy \(\nabla \bullet \mathbf{D}_1 = \rho_1\); \(\nabla \bullet \mathbf{D}_2 = \rho_2\); and \(\nabla \bullet \mathbf{D}_3 = \rho_3\) respectively. The following can then be computed:

\begin{itemize}
\item[a)]
The minimum energy multi-path \(\mathbf{D}_{1+2}\) that satisfies \(\nabla \bullet \mathbf{D}_{1+2} = \rho_1 + \rho_2\) is \(\mathbf{D}_{1+2} = \mathbf{D}_1 + \mathbf{D}_2\)
\begin{align*}
M(\rho_1 + \rho_2, \rho_3) = & \int (\mathbf{D}_{1+2} \bullet \mathbf{D}_3) = \int ((\mathbf{D}_1 + \mathbf{D}_2) \bullet \mathbf{D}_3) = \int (\mathbf{D}_1 \bullet \mathbf{D}_3) + \int (\mathbf{D}_2 \bullet \mathbf{D}_3) \\
= & M(\rho_1, \rho_3) + M(\rho_2, \rho_3)
\end{align*}

\subsection{Multi-loop inductance}

{\bf Inductance involving closed loops is nearly an identical concept to inductance involving balanced multi-points.} 

\vspace{5mm}

\textbf{Self inductance}

Given a multi-loop \(\mathbf{J}\), the ``self inductance" of \(\mathbf{J}\), often denoted by \(L(\mathbf{J})\), is the \(2 \times\) the minimum possible energy of the multi-surface whose boundary is \(\mathbf{J}\). If \(\mathbf{E}_{\text{min}}\) is the minimum energy multi-surface that satisfies \(\nabla \times \mathbf{E}_{\text{min}} = \mathbf{J}\), then 
\[L(\mathbf{J}) = \int (\mathbf{E}_{\text{min}} \bullet \mathbf{E}_{\text{min}})\]  

If \(\mathbf{F}\) were an arbitrary multi-surface whose boundary is \(\mathbf{J}\), \(\nabla \times \mathbf{F} = \mathbf{J}\), then \(L(\mathbf{J})\) can also be interpreted as follows. Since \(\epsilon(\mathbf{E}_{\text{min}})\) is a multi-loop (see theorem \ref{thm:low_energy_surface}) and \(\mathbf{E}_{\text{min}}\) and \(\mathbf{F}\) have the same boundary, it then follows from theorem \ref{thm:different_surfaces_same_result} that 
\[L(\mathbf{J}) = \int (\epsilon(\mathbf{E}_{\text{min}}) \bullet \mathbf{E}_{\text{min}}) = \int (\epsilon(\mathbf{E}_{\text{min}}) \bullet \mathbf{F})\]
In other words, \(L(\mathbf{J})\) is the total number of loops from \(\epsilon(\mathbf{E}_{\text{min}})\) that pass through \(\mathbf{F}\), therefore linking through \(\mathbf{J}\).

\vspace{5mm}

\textbf{Mutual inductance}

Given two multi-loops \(\mathbf{J}_1\) and \(\mathbf{J}_2\), the ``mutual inductance" between \(\mathbf{J}_1\) and \(\mathbf{J}_2\), often demoted by \(M(\mathbf{J}_1, \mathbf{J}_2)\), is defined as follows. 
Let \(\mathbf{E}_{\text{min},1}\) be the minimum energy multi-surface that satisfies \(\nabla \times \mathbf{E}_{\text{min},1} = \mathbf{J}_1\).
Let \(\mathbf{E}_{\text{min},2}\) be the minimum energy multi-surface that satisfies \(\nabla \times \mathbf{E}_{\text{min},2} = \mathbf{J}_2\). 
The mutual inductance is 
\[M(\mathbf{J}_1, \mathbf{J}_2) = \int (\mathbf{E}_{\text{min},1} \bullet \mathbf{E}_{\text{min},2})\]
One immediate observation is that \(M(\mathbf{J}_1, \mathbf{J}_2) = M(\mathbf{J}_2, \mathbf{J}_1)\). It is also worth noting that \(L(\mathbf{J}) = M(\mathbf{J},\mathbf{J})\).

If \(\mathbf{F}_1\) and \(\mathbf{F}_2\) are arbitrary multi-surfaces whose boundaries are \(\mathbf{J}_1\) and \(\mathbf{J}_2\) respectively, \(\nabla \times \mathbf{F}_1 = \mathbf{J}_1\) and \(\nabla \times \mathbf{F}_2 = \mathbf{J}_2\), then \(M(\mathbf{J}_1, \mathbf{J}_2)\) can be interpreted as follows. 

Since \(\epsilon(\mathbf{E}_{\text{min},2})\) is a multi-loop, it then follows from theorem \ref{thm:different_surfaces_same_result} that 
\[M(\mathbf{J}_1, \mathbf{J}_2) = \int (\epsilon(\mathbf{E}_{\text{min},2}) \bullet \mathbf{E}_{\text{min},1}) = \int (\epsilon(\mathbf{E}_{\text{min},2}) \bullet \mathbf{F}_1)\]
In other words, \(M(\mathbf{J}_1, \mathbf{J}_2)\) is the total number of loops from \(\epsilon(\mathbf{E}_{\text{min},2})\) that pass through \(\mathbf{F}_1\), therefore linking through \(\mathbf{J}_1\).

Since \(\epsilon(\mathbf{E}_{\text{min},1})\) is a multi-loop, it then follows from theorem \ref{thm:different_surfaces_same_result} that 
\[M(\mathbf{J}_1, \mathbf{J}_2) = \int (\epsilon(\mathbf{E}_{\text{min},1}) \bullet \mathbf{E}_{\text{min},2}) = \int (\epsilon(\mathbf{E}_{\text{min},1}) \bullet \mathbf{F}_2)\]
In other words, \(M(\mathbf{J}_1, \mathbf{J}_2)\) is the total number of loops from \(\epsilon(\mathbf{E}_{\text{min},1})\) that pass through \(\mathbf{F}_2\), therefore linking through \(\mathbf{J}_2\).

\vspace{5mm}

\textbf{Properties of the inductance}

\begin{thm}\label{thm:multi-loop_inductance_properties}
Let \(\mathbf{J}_1\), \(\mathbf{J}_2\), and \(\mathbf{J}_3\) be arbitrary multi-loops. Let \(c\) be an arbitrary real number. It is then the case that:

a)
\[M(\mathbf{J}_1 + \mathbf{J}_2, \mathbf{J}_3) = M(\mathbf{J}_1, \mathbf{J}_3) + M(\mathbf{J}_2, \mathbf{J}_3)\]

b)
\[M(c \cdot \mathbf{J}_1, \mathbf{J}_3) = c \cdot M(\mathbf{J}_1, \mathbf{J}_3)\]

c)
\[L(\mathbf{J}_1 + \mathbf{J}_2) = L(\mathbf{J}_1) + 2M(\mathbf{J}_1, \mathbf{J}_2) + L(\mathbf{J}_2)\]

d)
\[L(c \cdot \mathbf{J}_1) = c^2 \cdot L(\mathbf{J}_1)\]
\end{thm}
\textbf{Proof:}

Let \(\mathbf{E}_1\), \(\mathbf{E}_2\), and \(\mathbf{E}_3\) be the minimum energy multi-surfaces that satisfy \(\nabla \times \mathbf{E}_1 = \mathbf{J}_1\); \(\nabla \times \mathbf{E}_2 = \mathbf{J}_2\); and \(\nabla \times \mathbf{E}_3 = \mathbf{J}_3\) respectively. The following can then be computed:

The minimum energy multi-surface \(\mathbf{E}_{1+2}\) that satisfies \(\nabla \times \mathbf{E}_{1+2} = \mathbf{J}_1 + \mathbf{J}_2\) is \(\mathbf{E}_{1+2} = \mathbf{E}_1 + \mathbf{E}_2\)
\begin{align*}
M(\mathbf{J}_1 + \mathbf{J}_2, \mathbf{J}_3) = & \int (\mathbf{E}_{1+2} \bullet \mathbf{E}_3) = \int ((\mathbf{E}_1 + \mathbf{E}_2) \bullet \mathbf{E}_3) = \int (\mathbf{E}_1 \bullet \mathbf{E}_3) + \int (\mathbf{E}_2 \bullet \mathbf{E}_3) \\

\begin{align*}
M(c \cdot \mathbf{J}_1, \mathbf{J}_3) = & \int (\mathbf{E}_{c1} \bullet \mathbf{E}_3) = \int ((c \cdot \mathbf{E}_1) \bullet \mathbf{E}_3) = c\int (\mathbf{E}_1 \bullet \mathbf{E}_3) \\

\begin{align*}
L(\mathbf{J}_1 + \mathbf{J}_2) = & \int (\mathbf{E}_{1+2} \bullet \mathbf{E}_{1+2}) = \int ((\mathbf{E}_1 + \mathbf{E}_2) \bullet (\mathbf{E}_1 + \mathbf{E}_2)) \\

\begin{align*}
L(c \cdot \mathbf{J}_1) = & \int (\mathbf{E}_{c1} \bullet \mathbf{E}_{c1}) = \int ((c \cdot \mathbf{E}_1) \bullet (c \cdot \mathbf{E}_1)) = c^2\int (\mathbf{E}_1 \bullet \mathbf{E}_1) \\
= & c^2 \cdot L(\mathbf{J}_1)
\end{align*} 
\end{itemize}   



\section{Scalar $\epsilon$}

\begin{tabular}{cc}
\parbox{0.5\textwidth}{
In many scenarios, the duality relationship \(\epsilon\) is simply the following: Let \(\mathbf{E}\) denote an arbitrary multi-surface. At an arbitrary position \(\mathbf{q}\), consider a cylinder that is parallel to the dual multi-path \(\mathbf{D} = \epsilon(\mathbf{E})\). Let \(\Delta A\) denote the area of this cylinder, and let \(\Delta l\) denote the length of this cylinder. Let \(w_{\text{total\_path\_weight}}\) denote the total path weight from \(\mathbf{D}\) that runs the length of the cylinder. Let \(w_{\text{total\_surface\_weight}}\) denote the total surface weight from \(\mathbf{E}\) that slices through the cylinder, perpendicular to the length. 

Duality is quantified by a single number \(\epsilon\), such that the path weight per unit area is \(\epsilon\) times the surface weight per unit length: 
\[\frac{w_{\text{total\_path\_weight}}}{\Delta A} = \epsilon \cdot \frac{w_{\text{total\_surface\_weight}}}{\Delta l}\]
} & \parbox{0.5\textwidth}{
\includegraphics[width = 0.5\textwidth]{Duality/scalar_epsilon}
}
\end{tabular}

The number \(\epsilon\) has units of \(\text{m}^{-1}\).

It should be noted that the number \(\epsilon\) can change from position to position. In the image below, a dual multi-path/multi-surface pair \(\mathbf{D} = \epsilon(\mathbf{E})\) is shown crossing between two regions where \(\epsilon\) is different. When the conditions that \(\mathbf{D}\) has no endpoints (\(\nabla \bullet \mathbf{D} = 0\)) and \(\mathbf{E}\) has no boundaries (\(\nabla \times \mathbf{E} = 0\)) are enforced, the following conditions must hold to ensure no break in the paths' and surfaces' continuity. 

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width = 0.75\textwidth]{Duality/refraction}
\end{center}

The values of \(\epsilon\) in the two regions are denoted by \(\epsilon_{\text{small}}\) and \(\epsilon_{\text{large}}\).

Consider a stretch of boundary with a length of \(\Delta L\), as depicted above. 

Let \(\Delta t\) denote the depth of this segment of boundary, not shown in the 2D image. 

Let \(\theta_{\text{small}}\) denote the angle that the paths make with the direction perpendicular to the boundary in the \(\epsilon_{\text{small}}\) region, and let \(\theta_{\text{large}}\) denote the angle that the paths make with the direction perpendicular to the boundary in the \(\epsilon_{\text{large}}\) region. These are also the angles that the surfaces make with the boundary in their respective regions.

Let \(D_{\text{total}}\) denote the total path weight that crosses this segment. 

Let \(E_{\text{total}}\) denote the total surface weight that crosses this segment. 

In the region with the small \(\epsilon\), 
\[\frac{D_{\text{total}}}{\Delta L\cos\theta_{\text{small}} \cdot \Delta t} = \epsilon_{\text{small}} \cdot \frac{E_{\text{total}}}{\Delta L\sin\theta_{\text{small}}}\] 

In the region with the large \(\epsilon\), 
\[\frac{D_{\text{total}}}{\Delta L\cos\theta_{\text{large}} \cdot \Delta t} = \epsilon_{\text{large}} \cdot \frac{E_{\text{total}}}{\Delta L\sin\theta_{\text{large}}}\] 

These equations respectively give: 

\[E_{\text{total}} = \tan\theta_{\text{small}} \cdot \frac{D_{\text{total}}}{\Delta t \cdot \epsilon_{\text{small}}} \quad\text{and}\quad E_{\text{total}} = \tan\theta_{\text{large}} \cdot \frac{D_{\text{total}}}{\Delta t \cdot \epsilon_{\text{large}}}\]

so 

\[\tan\theta_{\text{small}} \cdot \frac{D_{\text{total}}}{\Delta t \cdot \epsilon_{\text{small}}} = \tan\theta_{\text{large}} \cdot \frac{D_{\text{total}}}{\Delta t \cdot \epsilon_{\text{large}}} \iff \frac{\tan\theta_{\text{large}}}{\tan\theta_{\text{small}}} = \frac{\epsilon_{\text{large}}}{\epsilon_{\text{small}}}\]

Therefore: 

\[\frac{\tan\theta_{\text{large}}}{\tan\theta_{\text{small}}} = \frac{\epsilon_{\text{large}}}{\epsilon_{\text{small}}}\]

From this equation, it can be observed that the angle that paths make to a direction perpendicular to the boundary increases when the paths pass from a region with low \(\epsilon\) to a region with high \(\epsilon\), and vice versa. 

\begin{thm}\label{thm:path_refraction}
Consider two regions 1 and 2 separated by a flat boundary. Inside region 1, the duality relationship is defined by the single number \(\epsilon_1\), and inside region 2, the duality relationship is defined by the single number \(\epsilon_2\). Let multi-path \(\mathbf{D}\) and multi-surface \(\mathbf{E}\) be dual to each other, and be continuous and unbroken along the boundary between regions 1 and 2: \(\nabla \bullet \mathbf{D} = 0\) and \(\nabla \times \mathbf{E} = 0\). Let \(\theta_1\) denote the angle that the paths from \(\mathbf{D}\) make with the direction that is perpendicular to the boundary between regions 1 and 2, inside of region 1. Similarly, let \(\theta_2\) denote the angle that the paths from \(\mathbf{D}\) make with the direction that is perpendicular to the boundary between regions 1 and 2, inside of region 2. It is then the case that these angles are related via the equation:

\[\frac{\tan\theta_2}{\tan\theta_1} = \frac{\epsilon_2}{\epsilon_1}\]
\end{thm}



\section{Electrostatics and magnetostatics}

Now the behavior of electric and magnetic fields {\bf when there are no changes with respect to time} will be quantified. When there are no changes with respect to time, the electromagnetic field consists of the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item A {\bf multi-point} \(\rho_e\) that describes the electric charges. 
\item A {\bf multi-point} \(\rho_m\) that describes the ``magnetic charges".
\item A {\bf multi-path} \(\mathbf{J}_e\) that describes the electric current. 
\item A {\bf multi-path} \(\mathbf{J}_m\) that describes the ``magnetic current".
\item A {\bf multi-path} \(\mathbf{D}\) that describes the electric field lines. 
\item A {\bf multi-path} \(\mathbf{B}\) that describes the magnetic field lines.
\item A {\bf multi-surface} \(\mathbf{E}\) that describes the electric field. 
\item A {\bf multi-surface} \(\mathbf{H}\) that describes the magnetic field. 
\end{itemize} 

While ``magnetic charge" a.k.a. ``magnetic monopoles" are not known to exist, Maxwell's equations are more symmetric assuming their existence.  

There are {\bf two} path-surface duality relationships. Multi-path \(\mathbf{D}\) and multi-surface \(\mathbf{E}\) are dual to each other, and multi-path \(\mathbf{B}\) and multi-surface \(\mathbf{H}\) are dual to each other. {\bf However, the duality relationships are different for \(\mathbf{D}\) and \(\mathbf{E}\) vs \(\mathbf{B}\) and \(\mathbf{H}\).}  

The symbol \(\epsilon\) used in the previous discussions will describe the duality between \(\mathbf{D}\) and \(\mathbf{E}\):
\[\mathbf{D} = \epsilon(\mathbf{E})\]

Since the duality relationship between \(\mathbf{B}\) and \(\mathbf{H}\) differs from the relationship between \(\mathbf{D}\) and \(\mathbf{E}\), a different symbol \(\mu\) will describe the duality between \(\mathbf{B}\) and \(\mathbf{H}\):
\[\mathbf{B} = \mu(\mathbf{H})\]

The equations that describe unchanging electric and magnetic fields are:

\begin{tabular}{ll}
\parbox{0.3\textwidth}{\[\nabla \bullet \mathbf{D} = \rho_e\]} & \parbox{0.7\textwidth}{(Electric charges are the endpoints of the electric field lines.)} \\ 
\parbox{0.3\textwidth}{\[\nabla \bullet \mathbf{B} = \rho_m\]} & \parbox{0.7\textwidth}{(Magnetic charges are the endpoints of the magnetic field lines.)} \\ 
\parbox{0.3\textwidth}{\[\nabla \times \mathbf{E} = -\mathbf{J}_m\]} & \parbox{0.7\textwidth}{(The magnetic current is the clockwise boundary of the electric field surfaces.)} \\ 
\parbox{0.3\textwidth}{\[\nabla \times \mathbf{H} = \mathbf{J}_e\]} & \parbox{0.7\textwidth}{(The electric current is the counterclockwise boundary of the magnetic field surfaces.)} \\ 
\end{tabular}

\vspace{5mm}

What units are weights measured in for each of these multi-structures? 
\begin{itemize}
\item With regards to multi-point \(\rho_e\) and multi-path \(\mathbf{D}\), weight is measured using ``Coulombs" (C), which are units of electric charge. 
\item With regards to multi-point \(\rho_m\) and multi-path \(\mathbf{B}\), weight is measured using ``Webers" (Wb), which are effectively units of magnetic charge. 
\item With regards to the multi-path \(\mathbf{J}_m\) and the multi-surface \(\mathbf{E}\), weight is measured using ``Volts" (V), which are units of energy per unit electric charge, or alternately, units of magnetic current. 
\item With regards to the multi-path \(\mathbf{J}_e\) and the multi-surface \(\mathbf{H}\), weight is measured using ``Amperes" (A), which are units of electric current, or alternately, units of energy per unit magnetic charge. 
\end{itemize}

With magnetic monopoles not known to exist, it is always the case that \(\rho_m = 0\) and \(\mathbf{J}_m = 0\). This means that \(\nabla \bullet \mathbf{B} = 0\) and \(\nabla \times \mathbf{E} = 0\), implying that \(\mathbf{B}\) is a multi-loop and \(\mathbf{E}\) is a multi-bubble. Because \(\mathbf{E}\) is a multi-bubble, there exists some multi-volume \(V\) such that the outwards oriented surface of \(V\) is \(\mathbf{E}\):
\[\nabla V = -\mathbf{E}\]  
Multi-volume \(V\) is referred to as the ``electric potential". Given an arbitrary position \(\mathbf{q}\), the net number of volumes from \(V\) that contain \(\mathbf{q}\), a.k.a. \(V(\mathbf{q})\), is the ``electric potential" at position \(\mathbf{q}\).

The function \(\epsilon(\cdot)\) that converts the electric field \(\mathbf{E}\) to the electric field lines \(\mathbf{D}\) is referred to as the ``electric permittivity".

The function \(\mu(\cdot)\) that converts the magnetic field \(\mathbf{H}\) to the magnetic field lines \(\mathbf{B}\) is referred to as the ``magnetic permeability".




\subsection{Special scenarios}

\textbf{Point charges}

\begin{tabular}{cc}
\parbox{0.5\textwidth}{
The assumption that is being made from the equation \(\nabla \bullet \mathbf{D} = \rho_e\) is that \(\rho_e\) is a balanced multi-point, \(\int \rho_e = 0\). This means that the total charge in a system is \(0\). If the net charge in the system is nonzero, say \(\int \rho_e = Q_{\text{total}}\), then an amount of charge equal to \(-Q_{\text{total}}\) is distributed in a spherical shell at extremely far distances.
