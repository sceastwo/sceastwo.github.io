%\subsection*{Periodic Functions}
%
%Given a periodic function \(f(x)\) with a period of \(T\), then for all \(x \in \mathbb{R}\), 
%\[\cdots = f(x - 3T) = f(x - 2T) = f(x - T) = f(x) = f(x + T) = f(x + 2T) = f(x + 3T) = \cdots\]
%
%\begin{itemize}
%\item If \(m\) and \(c\) are arbitrary real numbers, and \(m \neq 0\), then the period of the function \(g(x) = f(mx + c)\) is \(\frac{T}{|m|}\). 
%\item For the periodic function \(f(x)\), \(x\) has to increase or decrease by the amount \(T\) for \(f(x)\) to repeat itself. 
%\item In the case of \(g(x) = f(mx + c)\), the expression \(mx + c\) has to increase or decrease by the amount \(T\) for \(g(x)\) to repeat itself. 
%	\begin{itemize}
%	\item[*] For \(mx + c\) to increase or decrease by the amount \(T\), \(mx\) has to increase or decrease by the amount \(T\) as \(c\) does not change. 
%	\item[*] For \(mx\) to increase or decrease by the amount \(T\), \(x\) has to increase or decrease by the amount \(\left|\frac{T}{m}\right| = \frac{T}{|m|}\). 
%	\item[*] The increase of \(\frac{T}{|m|}\) is the period of \(g(x)\).
%	\end{itemize}
%\end{itemize}
%
%\textbf{Examples:}
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Let \(g(x) = \sin(57^\circ - 4x)\). Firstly, \(f(x) = \sin(x)\) has a period of \(360^\circ\). For \(g(x)\) to repeat itself, \(57^\circ - 4x\) must change by \(360^\circ\), so \(x\) must change by \(\frac{360^\circ}{|-4|} = 90^\circ\). The period of \(g(x)\) is \(90^\circ\).

\subsection*{Displacement between two points}

\begin{tabular}{cc}
\parbox{0.5\textwidth}{
Given two points \(A(x_1,y_1)\) and \(B(x_2,y_2)\), the displacement \(\mathbf{d}\) from point \(A\) to point \(B\) is \(\mathbf{d} = \langle x_2 - x_1, y_2 - y_1 \rangle\). The horizontal component of \(\mathbf{d}\) is the change in the \(x\)-coordinate from \(A\) to \(B\), while the vertical component of \(\mathbf{d}\) is the change in the \(y\)-coordinate from \(A\) to \(B\). \\
\textbf{Examples:}
\begin{itemize}
\item The displacement from \(A(-3,2)\) to \(B(4,-1)\) is \(\mathbf{d} = \langle 7, -3 \rangle\).
\item The displacement from \(A(11,-2)\) to \(B(3,5)\) is \(\mathbf{d} = \langle -8, 7 \rangle\).
\item The displacement from \(A(5,8)\) to \(B(7,0)\) is \(\mathbf{d} = \langle 2, -8 \rangle\).
\end{itemize}

Also, given a point \(A(x,y)\) and a displacement vector \(\mathbf{d} = \langle d_x, d_y \rangle\), the resultant point \(B\) from moving through a displacement of \(\mathbf{d}\) starting from point \(A\) is \(B(x + d_x, y + d_y)\). \\
\textbf{Examples:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Starting from point \(A(6,-2)\), moving a displacement of \(\mathbf{d} = \langle -3, 5 \rangle\) arrives at the point \(B(3,3)\).
\item Starting from point \(A(-1,-7)\), moving a displacement of \(\mathbf{d} = \langle 2, 4 \rangle\) arrives at the point \(B(1,-3)\).
\item Starting from point \(A(-4, 7)\), moving a displacement of \(\mathbf{d} = \langle 4, -1 \rangle\) arrives at the point \(B(0,6)\).

%\item A length of \(r\), and an angle of \(\theta\) left of the positive y-axis: \(\mathbf{v} = \langle -r\sin\theta, r\cos\theta \rangle\)
%\item A length of \(r\), and an angle of \(\theta\) above the negative x-axis: \(\mathbf{v} = \langle -r\cos\theta, r\sin\theta \rangle\)

%\item When \(x \geq 0\) and \(y \leq 0\), the angle to the right of the negative y-axis is \(\tan^{-1}(|x|/|y|)\), and the angle below the positive x-axis is \(\tan^{-1}(|y|/|x|)\).
%\end{itemize}
%
%
%\textbf{Examples:}
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Given a vector \(\mathbf{v}\) where \(\|\mathbf{v}\| = 5\) and the direction is \(\theta = 30^\circ\) above the positive x-axis, then \(\mathbf{v} = \langle 5\cos 30^\circ, 5\sin 30^\circ \rangle \approx \langle 4.330, 2.500 \rangle\)
%\item Given a vector \(\mathbf{v}\) where \(\|\mathbf{v}\| = 6\) and the direction is \(\theta = 20^\circ\) left of the negative y-axis, then \(\mathbf{v} = \langle -6\sin 20^\circ, -6\cos 20^\circ \rangle \approx \langle -2.052, -5.638 \rangle\)
%\item Given a vector \(\mathbf{v}\) where \(\|\mathbf{v}\| = 7\) and the direction is \(\theta = 25^\circ\) beneath the positive x-axis, then \(\mathbf{v} = \langle 7\cos 25^\circ, -7\sin 25^\circ \rangle \approx \langle 6.344, -2.958 \rangle\)

%
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Given the vector \(\mathbf{v} = \langle -2, 8 \rangle\), then the length is \(\|\mathbf{v}\| = \sqrt{(-2)^2 + 8^2} = \sqrt{4 + 64} = \sqrt{68} \approx 8.246\), and the direction can be quantified as either \(\theta = \tan^{-1}(2/8) \approx 14.04^\circ\) left of the positive y-axis, or \(\theta = \tan^{-1}(8/2) \approx 75.96^\circ\) above the negative x-axis.
%\item Given the vector \(\mathbf{v} = \langle -3, -5 \rangle\), then the length is \(\|\mathbf{v}\| = \sqrt{(-3)^2 + (-5)^2} = \sqrt{9 + 25} = \sqrt{34} \approx 5.831\), and the direction can be quantified as either \(\theta = \tan^{-1}(5/3) \approx 59.04^\circ\) below the negative x-axis, or \(\theta = \tan^{-1}(3/5) \approx 30.96^\circ\) left of the negative y-axis.
%\end{itemize}



\subsection*{Unit vectors}

\begin{tabular}{cc}
\parbox{0.7\textwidth}{
A {\bf unit vector} is a vector with a length of \(1\). Given an arbitrary vector \(\mathbf{v}\), a commonly sought quantity is a unit vector \(\mathbf{u}\) that shares the same direction as \(\mathbf{v}\). Since \(\mathbf{u}\) shares the same direction as \(\mathbf{v}\), unit vector \(\mathbf{u}\) is a multiple of \(\mathbf{v}\). To change the length from \(\|\mathbf{v}\|\) to \(1\), multiplication by \(\frac{1}{\|\mathbf{v}\|}\) is needed. Therefore \(\mathbf{u} = \frac{1}{\|\mathbf{v}\|}\mathbf{v} = \frac{\mathbf{v}}{\|\mathbf{v}\|}\) is the unit vector that shares the same direction as \(\mathbf{v}\). 

\textbf{Examples:}
\begin{itemize}
\item If \(\mathbf{v} = \langle -4, 3 \rangle\), the unit vector \(\mathbf{u}\) that shares the same direction as \(\mathbf{v}\) is sought. \(\|\mathbf{v}\| = \sqrt{(-4)^2 + 3^2} = \sqrt{16 + 9} = \sqrt{25} = 5\) so \(\mathbf{u} = \frac{\mathbf{v}}{\|\mathbf{v}\|} = \langle -0.8, 0.6 \rangle\). 
\item If \(\mathbf{v} = \langle -23, -40 \rangle\), the unit vector \(\mathbf{u}\) that shares the same direction as \(\mathbf{v}\) is sought. \(\|\mathbf{v}\| = \sqrt{(-23)^2 + (-40)^2} \approx 46.1411\) so \(\mathbf{u} = \frac{\mathbf{v}}{\|\mathbf{v}\|} \approx \langle -0.498471 , -0.866906 \rangle\).

Consider an arbitrary equation \(f(x,y) = g(x,y)\), where \(f(x,y)\) and \(g(x,y)\) are arbitrary expressions involving \(x\) and \(y\). The set of points that satisfy this equation forms a curve, where a point \((x,y)\) is included on the curve if and only if \((x,y)\) satisfies \(f(x,y) = g(x,y)\). This curve is referred to the {\bf graph} of \(f(x,y) = g(x,y)\) or the {\bf locus} of points that satisfies \(f(x,y) = g(x,y)\). \\
The purpose of the equation \(f(x,y) = g(x,y)\) is to distinguish between points that are part of the curve, and points that are not part of the curve. Given an arbitrary point \((x, y)\), the equation \(f(x,y) = g(x,y)\) is true if and only if point \((x, y)\) is part of the curve graphed by \(f(x,y) = g(x,y)\). \\
In the image on the right, the graph of the equation \(y = x^2\) is shown. In this case, \(f(x, y) = y\) and \(g(x, y) = x^2\). Given the point \((x, y) = (-1, 1)\) for example, \(y = 1\) and \(x^2 = 1\) so the equation is satisfied, and \((-1, 1)\) is part of the curve. Given the point \((x, y) = (2, 1)\) for example, \(y = 1\) and \(x^2 = 4\) so the equation is falsified, and \((2, 1)\) is not part of the curve. \\
This equation \(y = x^2\) is also equivalent to the equation \(x^2 - y = 0\), where \(f(x, y) = x^2 - y\) and \(g(x, y) = 0\).

Consider a curve with the equation 
\[f(x,y) = g(x,y)\] 
Shifting this curve by a displacement of \(\langle a, b \rangle\), the equation of the new shifted curve can be derived as follows: If point \((x_\text{old}, y_\text{old})\) lies on the original curve, then point \((x_\text{new}, y_\text{new}) = (x_\text{old}+a, y_\text{old}+b)\) lies on the shifted curve.

Therefore:

Consider a curve with the equation

Scaling the curve by a factor of \(k_x\) parallel to the \(x\)-axis, and by a factor of \(k_y\) parallel to the \(y\)-axis, the equation of the new scaled curve can be derived as follows: If point \((x_\text{old}, y_\text{old})\) lies on the original curve, then point \((x_\text{new}, y_\text{new}) = (k_x x_\text{old}, k_y y_\text{old})\) lies on the scaled curve.

\section*{Lines}

Now will be described the equations whose graphs are {\bf lines}.

\begin{tabular}{cc}
\parbox{0.5\textwidth}{
Important to lines is the ``gradient" or ``slope" of the line. The slope quantifies the ``steepness" of the line, and is defined as the change in the \(y\)-coordinate for a change of \(1\) in the \(x\) coordinate. Given two points \(A(x_1, y_1)\) and \(B(x_2, y_2)\) and the line that passes through \(A\) and \(B\), the change of \(x_2 - x_1\) in the \(x\)-coordinate corresponds to a change of \(y_2 - y_1\) in the \(y\)-coordinate. The change in the \(y\)-coordinate per change of \(1\) in the \(x\)-coordinate is the gradient: 
\[m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}\] 
} & \parbox{0.5\textwidth}{
\includegraphics[width = 0.5\textwidth]{gradient}
}
\end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{cc}
\parbox{0.5\textwidth}{
The equation of a line \(L_0\) with a gradient of \(m\) and that passes through the origin point is \(y = mx\). Starting at \((0,0)\), increasing the \(x\)-coordinate to \(x\) changes the \(y\)-coordinate to \(y = mx\). Now if it is known that line \(L\) passes through the point \((x_0, y_0)\), then displacing line \(L_0\) by a displacement of \(\langle x_0, y_0 \rangle\) so that the point at the origin has been moved to \((x_0, y_0)\), the new equation for line \(L\) is \(y - y_0 = m(x - x_0)\). This equation can also easily be observed by noting that if \((x_0, y_0)\) lies on \(L\), then increasing \(x_0\) by the amount \(x - x_0\) to \(x\), will also increase \(y_0\) by the amount \(y - y_0 = m(x - x_0)\) by definition of the gradient. Therefore:
\[y - y_0 = m(x - x_0)\] 
is the equation of line \(L\).
} & \parbox{0.5\textwidth}{
\includegraphics[width = 0.5\textwidth]{gradient_3}
}
\end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{cc}
\parbox{0.5\textwidth}{
If the point that line \(L\) passes through is the \(y\)-intercept \((0, c)\), then the equation of line \(L\) is:
\[y - c = m(x - 0) \iff y = mx + c\]
The equation \(y = mx + c\) is the most common form of equation for a line. The equation \(y - y_0 = m(x - x_0)\) will often be manipulated to \(y = mx + (y_0 - mx_0)\).
} & \parbox{0.5\textwidth}{
\includegraphics[width = 0.5\textwidth]{gradient_4}
}
\end{tabular}

The standard equation of the line that is being used is:
\[y = mx + c\]
where \(m\) is the gradient of the line, and \(c\) is the \(y\)-axis intercept. The slope \(m\) is the change in \(y\) \emph{per unit change} in \(x\): \(m = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}\) where \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) are points from the line. The \(y\)-axis intercept \(c\) is the value attained by \(y\) when the line crosses the \(y\)-axis, which occurs when \(x = 0\). 

Given two points \(A(x_1, y_1)\) and \(B(x_2, y_2)\), the process of finding the equation of the line \(L\) that passes through points \(A\) and \(B\) can be summarized as follows: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Compute the slope \(m\) of line \(L\): 
\[m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}\]
\item Start with \(y = mx\), which is the equation of a line with a slope of \(m\) that contains the origin \((0, 0)\). Move this line through a displacement of \(\langle x_1, y_1 \rangle\) so that the origin is moved to point \(A\). This results in an equation for line \(L\):
\[y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)\]
Alternately, the line \(y = mx\) can be moved through the displacement \(\langle x_2, y_2 \rangle\) so that the origin is moved to point \(B\). This results in an {\bf equivalent} equation for line \(L\):
\[y - y_2 = m(x - x_2)\]
\item Solve the equation for \(y\) as an expression of \(x\). This equation will have the desired form 
\[y = mx + c\]
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Examples:}
\begin{itemize}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item Start with the two points \(A(-2, -5)\) and \(B(3, 8)\). The slope of the line that connects points \(A\) and \(B\) is \(m = \frac{8 - (-5)}{3 - (-2)} = \frac{13}{5}\). Using point \(A\), the equation of the line that contains both \(A\) and \(B\) is: 
\[y - (-5) = \frac{13}{5}(x - (-2)) \iff y = -5 + (\frac{13}{5}x + \frac{26}{5}) \iff y = \frac{13}{5}x + \frac{1}{5}\]
The equation of the line that contains both \(A\) and \(B\) is:
\[y = \frac{13}{5}x + \frac{1}{5}\]
To check that \(A\) and \(B\) are on this line, for point \(A(-2, -5)\) the equation becomes \(-5 = \frac{13}{5}(-2) + \frac{1}{5} \iff -5 = \frac{-25}{5} \iff -5 = -5\). For point \(B(3, 8)\) the equation becomes \(8 = \frac{13}{5}(3) + \frac{1}{5} \iff 8 = \frac{40}{5} \iff 8 = 8\).
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item Start with the two points \(A(-3,4)\) and \(B(4,-2)\). The slope of the line that connects points \(A\) and \(B\) is \(m = \frac{(-2) - 4}{4 - (-3)} = \frac{-6}{7}\). Using point \(A\), the equation of the line that contains both \(A\) and \(B\) is: 
\[y - 4 = -\frac{6}{7}(x - (-3)) \iff y = 4 + (-\frac{6}{7}x - \frac{18}{7}) \iff y = -\frac{6}{7}x + \frac{10}{7}\]
The equation of the line that contains both \(A\) and \(B\) is:
\[y = -\frac{6}{7}x + \frac{10}{7}\]
To check that \(A\) and \(B\) are on this line, for point \(A(-3, 4)\) the equation becomes \(4 = -\frac{6}{7}(-3) + \frac{10}{7} \iff 4 = \frac{28}{7} \iff 4 = 4\). For point \(B(4, -2)\) the equation becomes \(-2 = -\frac{6}{7}(4) + \frac{10}{7} \iff -2 = -\frac{14}{7} \iff -2 = -2\).
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item Start with the two points \(A(1,-4)\) and \(B(-5,2)\). The slope of the line that connects points \(A\) and \(B\) is \(m = \frac{2 - (-4)}{(-5) - 1} = \frac{6}{-6} = -1\). Using point \(A\), the equation of the line that contains both \(A\) and \(B\) is: 
\[y - (-4) = -1 \cdot (x - 1) \iff y = -4 + (-x + 1) \iff y = -x - 3\]
The equation of the line that contains both \(A\) and \(B\) is:
\[y = -x - 3\]
To check that \(A\) and \(B\) are on this line, for point \(A(1,-4)\) the equation becomes \(-4 = -1 - 3 \iff -4 = -4\). For point \(B(-5,2)\) the equation becomes \(2 = -(-5) - 3 \iff 2 = 2\).
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item Start with the two points \(A(5,2)\) and \(B(-4,-1)\). The slope of the line that connects points \(A\) and \(B\) is \(m = \frac{(-1) - 2}{(-4) - 5} = \frac{-3}{-9} = \frac{1}{3}\). Using point \(A\), the equation of the line that contains both \(A\) and \(B\) is: 
\[y - 2 = \frac{1}{3}(x - 5) \iff y = 2 + (\frac{1}{3}x - \frac{5}{3}) \iff y = \frac{1}{3}x + \frac{1}{3}\]
The equation of the line that contains both \(A\) and \(B\) is:
\[y = \frac{1}{3}x + \frac{1}{3}\]
To check that \(A\) and \(B\) are on this line, for point \(A(5,2)\) the equation becomes \(2 = \frac{1}{3}(5) + \frac{1}{3} \iff 2 = \frac{6}{3} \iff 2 = 2\). For point \(B(-4,-1)\) the equation becomes \(-1 = \frac{1}{3}(-4) + \frac{1}{3} \iff -1 = \frac{-3}{3} \iff -1 = -1\).
\end{itemize}



\subsection*{Converting equations to $y = mx + c$}

Sometimes, the equation of a line will not be given in the form \(y = mx + c\). When this is the case, the equation must be manipulated until the form \(y = mx + c\) is attained.

\item Given the equation \(3x - 7y = 14\), 
\[3x - 7y = 14 \iff 7y = 3x - 14 \iff y = \frac{3}{7}x - 2\]
so \(3x - 7y = 14\) is equivalent to \(y = \frac{3}{7}x - 2\)
%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item Given the equation \(-10x + 5y = 15\),
\[-10x + 5y = 15 \iff 5y = 10x + 15 \iff y = 2x + 3\]
so \(-10x + 5y = 15\) is equivalent to \(y = 2x + 3\)
%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item Given the equation \(6x - 7y + 13 = x + 3y - 7\), 
\[6x - 7y + 13 = x + 3y - 7 \iff 5x + 20 = 10y \iff y = \frac{1}{2}x + 2\] 
so \(6x - 7y + 13 = x + 3y - 7\) is equivalent to \(y = \frac{1}{2}x + 2\)
\end{itemize}




\subsection*{Vertical lines}

When a line is vertical, its slope is \(m = \infty\). The equation that quantifies a vertical line cannot take the form \(y = mx + c\), and instead has the form \(x = a\) where \(a\) is the value that \(x\) is fixed to. Examples include:
\begin{itemize}
\item \(x = -1\) is the equation of a vertical line where the \(x\)-coordinate is \(-1\) for all points on the line.
\item \(x = 3\) is the equation of a vertical line where the \(x\)-coordinate is \(3\) for all points on the line.
\item \(x = 1\) is the equation of a vertical line where the \(x\)-coordinate is \(1\) for all points on the line.
\end{itemize}



\subsection*{Perpendicular lines} 

\begin{tabular}{cc}
\parbox{0.5\textwidth}{
Consider two {\bf perpendicular} lines \(L_1\) and \(L_2\). Let the slopes of lines \(L_1\) and \(L_2\) be respectively denoted by \(m_1\) and \(m_2\). In the image on the right, there are two triangles. The upper triangle illustrates the slope of line \(L_1\), with a change in the \(x\)-coordinate of \(1\), and a change in the \(y\)-coordinate of \(m_1 \cdot 1 = m_1\). The lower triangle is congruent to the upper triangle, albeit rotated by \(90^\circ\). The lower triangle illustrates the slope of \(L_2\), with a change in the \(x\)-coordinate of \(m_1\), and a change in the \(y\)-coordinate of \(-1\). The slope of \(L_2\) is \(m_2 = \frac{-1}{m_1}\). Therefore:
\[m_2 = -\frac{1}{m_1}\]

\textbf{Examples:}
\begin{itemize}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item Consider the points \(A(-3, -1)\); \(B(5, 3)\); and \(C(4, -4)\). What is sought is the equation of a line \(L_2\) that passes through point \(C\) and is {\bf perpendicular} to the line \(L_1\) that passes through points \(A\) and \(B\). \\
The slope \(m_1\) of line \(L_1\) is \(m_1 = \frac{3 - (-1)}{5 - (-3)} = \frac{4}{8} = \frac{1}{2}\). The slope \(m_2\) of line \(L_2\) is \(m_2 = -\frac{1}{m_1} = -2\). The line \(y = -2x\) passes through the origin, and moving the origin to point \(C\) yields the following equation for \(L_2\):
\[y - (-4) = -2(x - 4) \iff y = -4 + (-2x + 8) = -2x + 4\]
The equation for \(L_2\) is: 
\[y = -2x + 4\]
%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item Consider the points \(A(3, -2)\); \(B(-2, 4)\); and \(C(8, -9)\). What is sought is the equation of a line \(L_2\) that passes through point \(C\) and is {\bf perpendicular} to the line \(L_1\) that passes through points \(A\) and \(B\). \\
The slope \(m_1\) of line \(L_1\) is \(m_1 = \frac{4 - (-2)}{-2 - 3} = \frac{6}{-5} = -\frac{6}{5}\). The slope \(m_2\) of line \(L_2\) is \(m_2 = -\frac{1}{m_1} = \frac{5}{6}\). The line \(y = \frac{5}{6}x\) passes through the origin, and moving the origin to point \(C\) yields the following equation for \(L_2\):
\[y - (-9) = \frac{5}{6}(x - 8) \iff y = -9 + (\frac{5}{6}x - \frac{20}{3}) = \frac{5}{6}x - \frac{47}{3}\]
The equation for \(L_2\) is: 
\[y = \frac{5}{6}x - \frac{47}{3}\]

\subsection*{Plotting lines: finding the intercept points}

It is often useful to draw a line from its equation to get a better understanding of its shape and behavior. One of the most efficient approaches to plotting a line to is to first compute the \(x\) and \(y\) intercepts, and then plot the intercept points and draw a line that passes through the two intercept points. Given a line whose equation is \(y = mx + c\), the \(y\) intercept point is clearly \((0, c)\). To find the \(x\) intercept point, the value of \(x\) that causes \(y = 0\) must be found:
\[0 = mx + c \iff x = -\frac{c}{m}\]  
this yields the intercept point \((-c/m, 0)\).

\textbf{Examples:}
\begin{itemize}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item The line \(y = \frac{2}{3}x + 5\) intersects the \(y\) axis at the point \((0, 5)\), and intersects the \(x\) axis when \(y = 0\). \(\frac{2}{3}x + 5 = 0 \iff x = -\frac{15}{2}\) so the \(x\) intercept is \((-15/2, 0)\). Draw a line through the points \((0, 5)\) and \((-15/2, 0)\) to plot the line \(y = \frac{2}{3}x + 5\).
%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item The line \(y = -\frac{1}{2}x + 7\) intersects the \(y\) axis at the point \((0, 7)\), and intersects the \(x\) axis when \(y = 0\). \(-\frac{1}{2}x + 7 = 0 \iff x = 14\) so the \(x\) intercept is \((14, 0)\). Draw a line through the points \((0, 7)\) and \((14, 0)\) to plot the line \(y = -\frac{1}{2}x + 7\).
%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item The line \(y = -\frac{3}{8}x + 6\) intersects the \(y\) axis at the point \((0, 6)\), and intersects the \(x\) axis when \(y = 0\). \(-\frac{3}{8}x + 6 = 0 \iff x = 16\) so the \(x\) intercept is \((16, 0)\). Draw a line through the points \((0, 6)\) and \((16, 0)\) to plot the line \(y = -\frac{3}{8}x + 6\).

\subsection*{Distance between two points}

\begin{tabular}{cc}
\parbox{0.5\textwidth}{
Given two points \(A(x_1, y_1)\) and \(B(x_2, y_2)\), the displacement from \(A\) to \(B\) is \(\mathbf{d} = \langle x_2 - x_1, y_2 - y_1 \rangle\). The distance from \(A\) to \(B\) is the length of this displacement which is \(d = \|\mathbf{d}\| = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}\). \\
\textbf{Examples:}
\begin{itemize}
\item The distance from \(A(-3,2)\) to \(B(4,-1)\) is \(d = \sqrt{7^2 + (-3)^2} = \sqrt{49 + 9} = \sqrt{58} \approx 7.61577\)
\item The distance from \(A(11,-2)\) to \(B(3,5)\) is \(d = \sqrt{(-8)^2 + 7^2} = \sqrt{64 + 49} = \sqrt{113} \approx 10.6301\)
\item The distance from \(A(5,8)\) to \(B(7,0)\) is \(d = \sqrt{2^2 + (-8)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 64} = \sqrt{68} = 2\sqrt{17} \approx 8.24621\)

\subsection*{Midpoint between two points}

\begin{tabular}{cc}
\parbox{0.5\textwidth}{
Given two points \(A(x_1, y_1)\) and \(B(x_2, y_2)\), the ``midpoint" \(C\) that is exactly halfway between points \(A\) and \(B\) is computed as follows: The displacement from point \(A\) to point \(B\) is \(\mathbf{d} = \langle x_2 - x_1, y_2 - y_1 \rangle\). The ``midpoint" \(C\) is reached from \(A\) by a displacement of \(\frac{\mathbf{d}}{2} = \langle \frac{x_2 - x_1}{2}, \frac{y_2 - y_1}{2} \rangle\). Shifting \(A\) by the displacement of \(\frac{\mathbf{d}}{2}\) gives \(C(x_1 + \frac{x_2 - x_1}{2}, y_1 + \frac{y_2 - y_1}{2}) = C(\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \frac{y_1 + y_2}{2})\). Therefore the midpoint is:
\[C(\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \frac{y_1 + y_2}{2})\]
\textbf{Examples:}
\begin{itemize}
\item The midpoint between \(A(-3,2)\) and \(B(4,-1)\) is \(C(\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2})\)
\item The midpoint between \(A(11,-2)\) and \(B(3,5)\) is \(C(7,\frac{3}{2})\)
\item The midpoint between \(A(5,8)\) and \(B(7,0)\) is \(C(6,4)\)

\subsection*{The equations of circles}

\begin{tabular}{cc}
\parbox{0.5\textwidth}{
Given a radius \(R > 0\), a circle of radius \(R\) that is centered on the origin is the set (locus) of all points that are a distance of \(R\) from the origin. A point \((x,y)\) is a distance of \(R\) from the origin if and only if \(\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} = R\) which is equivalent to \(x^2 + y^2 = R^2\). The equation 
\[x^2 + y^2 = R^2\] 
defines a circle of radius \(R\) that is centered on the origin. \\ 
Centering a circle of radius \(R\) on the point \((a,b)\) requires that the origin centered circle be shifted a displacement of \(\langle a, b \rangle\). This yields the equation
\[(x-a)^2 + (y-b)^2 = R^2\] 
which defines a circle of radius \(R\) that is centered on the point \((a,b)\).
